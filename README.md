# Prerequisites for [pg_pathman](https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_pathman) packaging

This repo contains everything you might need to create pg_pathman's system package. Currently we provide build scripts for:

* [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) (master branch)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)/[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (master branch, x86-64)

One day this list will definitely become larger.
